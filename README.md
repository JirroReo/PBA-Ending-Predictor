# PBA-Ending-Predictor
"Ending" is a Filipino basketball betting game, usually played on rectagular cardboard cards, where people bet money to guess the last digits of the two playing teams' final scores.

This is a python model built with pandas and sklearn that tries to predict the scores of the teams beforehand using stats from past matches.
Currently using sports-reference.com's API for datasets as I'm still looking for an API/Dataset from the PH Basketball Association, building a dataset of ~350 teams from the API takes about 120 minutes on a 4-threaded CPU.

Still a work in progress, contributions are more than welcome.
